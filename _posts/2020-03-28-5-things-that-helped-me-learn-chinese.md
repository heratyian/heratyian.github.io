1. The desire to learn
Hard to learn what you don’t really want to know. Learning a foreign language is a long difficult journey. It really takes a lifetime.

2. Pimsleur Recordings
These are great < 30 minute daily practices that you can do on your daily commute. (If you don’t mind talking to yourself in a foreign language) Also gives you a taste, comfort, and feel for a language.

3. Immersion
Nothing is better than living in a place where you have to use a language to live life.

4. Apps
Lots of great apps out there. I’ve used Du Chinese, Memrise, Pleco, and Drops. Use whatever works for you.

5. Human Dictionary
My Dad always said to find a “long haired dictionary”. Find a friend (any hair style) native in the language you want to speak. It’s always great when there is a specific activity. (Board game, sport, etc.)  That way the vocabulary is more focused.
