# Mastering New Skills: Insights from The Science of Rapid Skill Acquisition by Peter Hollins

I recently finished reading The Science of Rapid Skill Acquisition by Peter Hollins. This insightful guide explores strategies to acquire new skills both strategically and effectively. Many of the book's recommendations resonate with techniques I've honed through years of study and personal development. Others align with methods I've intuitively developed in my roles as an English teacher in China and a software development educator. Additionally, there are some suggestions Iâ€™ve often neglected due to ingrained habitsâ€”perhaps it's time to reconsider! ðŸ˜…

## Setting Learning Goals (And Why They Matter)

Having a clear purpose guides and focuses your learning journey.

For example:

- **Learning Spanish**: Is your why to make new friends, read Don Quixote in its original language, or become a tango dancer in Argentina?

Most significant skills require personal sacrificeâ€”youâ€™ll need to give up something to achieve them. Understanding your motivation helps maintain commitment and direction.

## Active vs. Reflective Learning

Active learning techniques, such as using flashcards, are highly effective. Merely reading notes passively isn't sufficient. Quizzing yourself helps identify gaps in your knowledge. Practice quizzes are invaluable, and with tools like ChatGPT, you can create customized quizzes based on your textbook or prompts, and even have your answers graded automatically.

## Strategic Planning

Research Resources: Find materials that best fit your learning style and goals.
Schedule Study Time: Consistency is key. Allocate specific times for studying to build a routine.

## Frequency vs. Duration

- **Avoid Cramming**: Short, frequent study sessions are more effective than long, infrequent ones.
- **Increase Review Frequency**: Regularly revisiting material helps reinforce learning better than extended single sessions.

## Interleaving

Our brains naturally shift between different ideas. Instead of studying the same topic repeatedly (e.g., AAA BBB CCC), interleave different aspects of a skill (e.g., ABC ACB). This approach enhances understanding and retention.

## Skill Stacking

You donâ€™t need to master one skill to excel. It's really competitive to be the best top 1% in any given skill. Instead, be proficient in several related skills to create a unique edge.

**My Example**: I already speak Chinese, write software, play tennis, have a cat, ride bikes and teach. Building on these existing skills allows me to develop a distinctive skill set that sets me apart.

## Problem-Based Learning

Elon Musk champions this approach. Traditional education often focuses on teaching tools rather than addressing real-world problems. Instead of just learning about screwdrivers, tackle a problem like fixing a car. This context helps you understand why and how specific tools are used appropriately.

## Embrace Being Uncomfortable

Learning a new skill inherently involves discomfort. Not understanding something can create insecurity, but it's a sign of growth. When you feel uneasy, lean into it and recognize that you're in the process of learning and improving.

## Leveraging Your Environment

Your surroundings can either give you an advantage or present challenges in learning certain skills. For instance, learning ice sculpting in Florida might be more difficult due to the climate, whereas other environments might offer unique opportunities. Also, make sure to surround yourself with people that support your learning goals. You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. Make sure you spend your time with people that support your goals.

## My Learning Goals for 2025

### Speak Cantonese Chinese
I already speak Mandarin Chinese so this would be "skill stacking". My wife and in-laws all speak Cantonese with each other. I also live near Chinatown in Chicago where most locals speak Cantonese (leveraging my environment). My "why" is to communicate more effectively with friends and family.

### Electronics
I am already proficient in developing software, but the hardware level has always been a bit of a mystery ("skill stacking"). I want to dig a bit deeper into the hardware level and understand how electricity works at a basic level. The principles used in electricity are the foundation of modern life. I want to demystify electricity and electronics. My "why" is to build an electronic musical instrument or wearable headset.

## My Next Steps

- Research Great Resources
- Set Up a Learning Schedule

By implementing these strategies, you can accelerate your skill acquisition and achieve your learning goals more efficiently. Happy learning!
