description: Setting my 2025 learning goals based on the science of rapid skill acquisition
---

I just finished reading [The Science of Rapid Skill Acquisition by Peter Hollins](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Rapid-Skill-Acquisition-Information-ebook/dp/B07NS6QNSR). Itâ€™s a guide of how to get strategically and effectively aquire new skills. Some of the recommendations in this book are techniques I've picked up through years of study and self development. Others are techniques I've intuitively developed in my role as an english teacher in China and a software development educator. Others are recommendations I often eschew due to bad habits. (maybe I should reconsider ðŸ˜…)

## setting learning goals (and why)

a purpose will guide and focus your learning.

for example, if you want to learn spanish, is the *why* to meet new friends? to read Don Quixote in original language? to become a tango dancer in Argentina? 

most great skills require a personal sacrifice

you'll have to give up something to get it

## active versus reflective learning

This is why flash cards work so well. It doesn't work to just passively read notes. You have to quiz yourself and see where the gaps are. It's a great idea to take practice quizzes. Now with tools like chatgpt, you can create your own gpt with a textbook or prompt and have it generate a quiz for you and grade your answers.

## strategic planning

- research resources that are a good fit
- schedule time to study

## frequency vs duration
- do not cram!
- increase the frequency of reviewing (not the duration)

## interleaving

Your brain naturally bounces from different ideas. Instead of studying the same topic AAA BBB CCC, it's better to practice different aspects of a skill in different order ABCACB

## skill stacking
don't have to be the best, just good at a few related skills to give you a unique edge

In my case I already speak some chinese, write software, and teach. I can build on top of these skill sets.

## problem based learning

Elon Musk is big on this. Our current education system teaches the tools, not the problem. Instead of teaching about screwdrivers, take on a problem like fixing a car. In this context you'll recognize *why* and *how* a screwdriver is used in the proper context.

## be comfortable being uncomfortable

learning a new skill is by default uncomfortable. it's uncomfortable not understanding. It can create insecurity! That's ok. It's a sign you're learning. When you have that discomfort, lean into it, and recognize that you're learning!

your environment can give you an edge (or disadvantage) in learning certain skills.
