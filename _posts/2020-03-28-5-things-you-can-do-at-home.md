1. ### Learn a new skill
Pick up a new skill from your home. There are free how to videos online. There are lots of websites to guide learning in a new field. Feeling anxious/insecure about your lack of knowledge in a specific field? Learn how to play music, speak a foreign language, fix up the home, code, or whatever floats your boat.

2. ### Exercise
You don’t need a gym membership in order to get/stay fit. Check out the Yoga with Adriene YouTube channel for free guided yoga videos. BeachBody has a subscription iOS app with more active home workouts. All you really need is a place to move around. 

3. ### Cook
Cook at home. Save money. Eat better and healthier. Include vegetables in your diet.

4. ### Clean
Don’t be a slob. Tidy up your living area.

5. ### Play Music
Listen to music. Go sing or play an instrument. Dance. It’s good for the soul.
