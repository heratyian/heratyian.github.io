I just finished reading [The Inner Game of Tennis by W. Timothy Gallwey](https://www.amazon.com/Inner-Game-Tennis-Classic-Performance/dp/0679778314), and it’s much more than a tennis guide. It’s a fascinating exploration of how to get out of your own way, find peace regardless of outcomes, and develop a mindset that enhances both athletic performance and enjoyment.

Many technology thought leaders discuss the concept of a flow state—a state of focused meditation that can be elusive yet transformative. Learning something with concrete focus, like tennis, offers a valuable opportunity to build intuition about broader flow state concepts. In some ways, accessing a flow state feels as abstract yet foundational as imaginary numbers in mathematics.

I hadn’t realized how much the mental side of sports was a challenge for me until reading this book. Here are some of my key takeaways:

## The Two Selves: The "Doer" and the "Teller"

Gallwey introduces the idea of two selves:

- Self 1 - The "teller" that uses language, analysis, and judgment.
- Self 2 - The "doer," a non-verbal genius responsible for executing actions. Self 2 can breathe, pump blood, coordinate muscles, and perform complex physical tasks with incredible precision.

> "Getting it together mentally in tennis involves the learning of several internal skills: 1. learning how to get the clearest possible picture of your desired outcomes; 2. learning how to trust Self 2 to perform at its best and learn from mistakes."

Self 2 doesn’t rely on language; it communicates through imagery and intuition. Gallwey emphasizes the importance of respecting Self 2 as an elder mentor and trusting its capabilities. For this to work, Self 1 must focus on creating a clear mental image of the desired outcome, leaving the execution to Self 2.

## Non-Judgmental Awareness
One of the book’s core principles is cultivating non-judgmental awareness—the art of observing events as they are, without labeling them as “good” or “bad.”

> "The first inner skill to be developed in the Inner Game is that of nonjudgmental awareness... the art of letting go the human inclination to judge ourselves and our performance as either good or bad."

In my family sporting competitions, we call this "phonics"- adding verbal emotions to what’s happening. We really should be noticing a mistake without attaching frustration or self-criticism. This practice doesn’t mean ignoring errors; it simply means observing events clearly without letting judgment tighten your movements.

> "Judgment results in tightness, and tightness interferes with the fluidity required for accurate and quick movement. Relaxation produces smooth strokes and results from accepting your strokes as they are, even if erratic."

## Relaxed Concentration
Gallwey calls for a state of “relaxed concentration,” where you allow your body and mind to work together harmoniously. When you trust Self 2 and stay at peace with it, you can perform at your best.

This resonates with my experience using the [Wim Hof breathing technique](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/breathing-exercises). Breathing is a powerful centering mechanism that helps cultivate a relaxed flow state. By focusing on your breath, you can let go of distractions and stay present in the moment.

## Applying These Lessons Beyond Tennis
The insights from The Inner Game of Tennis extend far beyond sports. By embracing non-judgmental awareness and learning to trust Self 2, I hope to improve not just in tennis, but in all areas of life. Whether it’s work, relationships, or creative pursuits, these techniques offer a pathway to greater flow, performance, and peace of mind.
